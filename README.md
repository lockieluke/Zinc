# Zinc - A browser that focuses on performance and privacy

Zinc is a browser that focuses on performance and privacy while keeping itself running with low resource usage. The
browser is written in TypeScript and it is based on Chromium and Electron framework(not to be scared). _Depending on
Electron doesn't mean its performance is bad._

#### What convince me to use Zinc?

As I said, Zinc focuses on performance and privacy while use only a little portion of your system resources. Zinc manages to use just 80 MB of RAM with 3 tabs opened. Zinc also has exclusive features for different regions.

#### Hey, why are you using Electron for a browser?

Many people said Electron is a horrible framework for desktop applications but no, Zinc proves us wrong. Zinc keeps itself fast while using very little amount of RAM. Therefore, stop bringing complains about Electron here, thank you! Enjoy!
